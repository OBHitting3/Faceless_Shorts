**Notes**

- **Payouts:** Gumroad, Payhip, Lemon Squeezy may ask for ID when you withdraw; use them to list and sell now, add ID when you have it.
- **Ads:** Facebook/Instagram/TikTok *ad accounts* often require ID; organic post + link in bio = no ID.
- **Monetization programs:** YouTube Partner, TikTok Creator Fund, etc. can require ID; you’re only linking to Gumroad, not enrolling in those yet.

**Tomorrow:** Renew state ID, then add any platforms that need it (e.g. Stripe Connect, ad accounts, payout verification).
