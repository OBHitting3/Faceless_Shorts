## Product name (title)

**Faceless Shorts Automator MVP – Topic to YouTube Short in One Flow**

---

## Short description (above the fold)

Turn any topic into a faceless YouTube Short on autopilot. One input → script, voiceover, and video assembly → direct upload. No face, no camera, no editing. Built on Make.com + Gemini + ElevenLabs + YouTube. Everything you need to run it yourself.

---

## Long description (full page)

**Stop editing. Start publishing.**

This is the same pipeline used to go from "Why the sky is blue" to a live Short on YouTube with almost zero hands-on work. You get the full project: folder structure, setup validator, and a step-by-step Make.com blueprint so you can plug in your own APIs and run the flow.

**What's inside**

- Ready-to-use project layout (config, scripts, docs, workflows)
- Python setup validator (checks API keys and config)
- Make.com scenario blueprint: trigger → Gemini (script) → ElevenLabs (voice) → video assembly → YouTube upload
- Architecture doc and clear instructions
- .env.example and .gitignore so you never commit secrets
- Optional: add your own templates and voices

**What you need (your own accounts)**

- Google Gemini API (free tier works)
- ElevenLabs API key
- YouTube Data API v3 (OAuth – we show you where it goes)
- Make.com account (free tier to start)
- Creatomate or JSON2Video for video assembly (~$0.20–$1 per Short)

**Who this is for**

- Creators who want faceless Shorts without daily editing
- Marketers testing short-form content at scale
- Anyone who’s ready to connect a few APIs and run a no-code scenario

**What you get**

- Instant download: ZIP with the full repo (README, scripts, docs, workflow blueprint). No subscription. Use it forever.

**Compliance**

- AI disclosure text is included in the upload description template so your Shorts stay platform-friendly.

## Price suggestion
