- **2026-02-14** Bible-of-Terms added to repo (docs/BIBLE-OF-TERMS.md). GUMROAD-EXECUTE-NOW.md created on Desktop with terms reference. Stripe (AI Over Coffee) implemented per 55+Billing; Gumroad copy ready for Faceless Shorts.
- **2026-02-14** Cleaned Bible-of-Terms: removed meta-text, added spacing and headers, saved as Bible-of-Terms.md; deleted old extensionless file.
- **2026-02-14 ~2:30** Set up handoff: created CLAUDE-CURSOR-HANDOFF.md + Cursor rule to append status after each task.
- **faceless-shorts-mvp:** Pipeline runs (Script→Voice→Video). YouTube upload needs `auth_youtube.py` once. Gemini 429 / ElevenLabs 401 → fallbacks used.
- **Git:** Repo initialized, remote set. Push works from your Cursor terminal.
