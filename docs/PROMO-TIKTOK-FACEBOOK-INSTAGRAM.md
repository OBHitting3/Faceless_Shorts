# Promo Strategy – TikTok, Facebook, Instagram

Use these to **sell** the Faceless Shorts Automator on Gumroad and **build your list** (link in bio → Gumroad or email).

---

## TikTok

**Format:** 15–30 sec hooks. One idea per video. CTA: "Link in bio" or "Comment SHORTS for the link."

- **Hook 1:** "I don’t show my face. I don’t edit. I just type a topic and my Short goes up. Here’s the stack." → show Make.com + Gemini + ElevenLabs in 3 quick cuts.
- **Hook 2:** "Faceless Shorts in 5 minutes a day. Topic in, Short uploaded. No camera." → screen record of one run (blur keys).
- **Hook 3:** "Stop editing Shorts by hand. This flow does script, voice, and upload. I packaged it." → link in bio.
- **Hook 4:** "Why the sky is blue" → show the same topic going in and the Short going live. "One input. That’s it."
- **Caption template:** Short hook line + "Full MVP in my bio. No subscription." + 2–3 hashtags (#facelessyoutube #shortsautomation #nocode).

**Posting:** 3–5x/week. Test hooks; double down on what gets saves and profile visits.

## Facebook

**Format:** Short posts + single image or 30–60s video. Groups (creator/marketing/no-code) + Page + optional Ads.

- **Post 1 (Groups):** "I built a 95% automated pipeline for faceless YouTube Shorts – topic in, Short uploaded. Make.com + Gemini + ElevenLabs + YouTube. Packaged the whole thing so you can run it with your own APIs. Link in comments if you want the MVP." (Then comment with Gumroad link.)
- **Post 2 (Page):** Same message, shorter. Image: simple diagram (Topic → Script → Voice → Video → Upload) or screenshot of folder structure.
- **Post 3:** "No face, no camera, no editing. Just a topic and a few API keys. Here’s what’s inside the pack." → link.
- **Ads (optional):** Target interest in YouTube Shorts, faceless YouTube, no-code, side hustle. Single image or short video + "Get the Faceless Shorts Automator MVP" → Gumroad.

**Posting:** 1–2x/week in groups (follow rules); 2–3x/week on Page.

## Instagram

**Format:** Reels (same hooks as TikTok) + carousel (what’s inside / how it works) + Stories (screenshots, "link in bio").

- **Reels:** Reuse TikTok hooks 1–4; same CTAs. Hashtags: #facelessyoutube #shortsautomation #nocode #creatoreconomy #youtubeshorts.
- **Carousel (9 slides):** 1) Cover: "Faceless Shorts Automator – what’s inside." 2–8) One slide each: Topic in → Script (Gemini) → Voice (ElevenLabs) → Video (Creatomate) → Upload (YouTube) + "Your APIs, your channel." 9) "Get the full MVP – link in bio."
- **Stories:** "New: Faceless Shorts MVP in bio." / "Topic → Short. No editing. Link in bio." / Screenshot of README or Make blueprint with "Everything’s in the pack."
- **Bio:** One line about faceless Shorts + "MVP in my link" (Linktree/Gumroad direct).

**Posting:** Reels 3–4x/week; carousel 1x; Stories daily when launching or promoting.

## Cross-posting

- **TikTok ↔ Reels:** Same clips, different captions/hashtags. No need to change the creative.
- **Facebook:** Use the best-performing Reel/TikTok as a native video post or ad creative.
- **One link:** Point everything to the same Gumroad page (or a short redirect) so you can track "link in bio" traffic.

## Compliance

- In any demo, don’t show real API keys. Use placeholders or blur.
- When showing YouTube uploads, keep AI disclosure visible in the description so the promo matches the product.
