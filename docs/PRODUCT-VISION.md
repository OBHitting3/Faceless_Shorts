# Product Vision — Video Production System

**Last updated:** 2026-02-14

## What the product is

A **system or workflow** that creates videos. The software uses the tool we're making to do editing, design, and assembly.

**Length:** Any. Not limited to shorts. You control it.

- **Sliding scale** — you judge the time, length, everything
- **Shorts** — current focus for this project (MVP)
- **Long-form** — once shorts work, we extend to long videos
- **Full-length** — we want to be able to make a movie if we want

---

## Current vs future

| Phase | Length | What we're doing |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| **Now (MVP)** | Shorts only | Prove the pipeline; shorts first |
| **Later** | Long video | Same system, extended; you set duration |
| **Future** | Movie-length | Same system; sliding scale all the way |

The product is **video production** — length is a parameter you control, not a hard limit.

## What the tool does

- Script generation
- Voice (ElevenLabs)
- Visuals (Runway, Midjourney, Pika)
- Assembly (Python/MoviePy now; CapCut for polish)
- Editing and design — the tool handles it; you set the parameters

---

**Rule:** Build for any length from the start. Use shorts to validate; scale up when ready.
